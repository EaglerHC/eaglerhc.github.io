Hello guys, this hosting development has stopped because I don't have the time, money, or self-esteem to continue working on it. I also realized that only about five people even checked out the project, and despite my efforts, I only made around $10-20 from donations (no kidding), which just isn't enough to sustain or justify working on this any further. That being said, I am giving everything away FOR FREE so that anyone can take it and build their own hosting service from it. This was supposed to be a free 24/7/365 hosting platform, and while I couldn't make it work long-term, maybe someone else can. If you want the website/hosting-service to be owned by you text me on remind: https://www.remind.com/join/scwbyra123 .
